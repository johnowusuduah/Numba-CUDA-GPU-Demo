# Numba-CUDA-GPU-Demo

This is a demonstration of how to use Numba library to do CUDA GPU programming.

I imported a data frame of 30 years of housing price data set in pandas, carried out some data pre-processing, vectorized it with Numba library so that it can run on the GPU after which I copied the resultant arrays to the GPU with CUDA so that the GPU for parallel computation.

Kindly refer to jupyter notebook entitled Numba_CUDA_GPU_Programming for code outlining full implementation.
